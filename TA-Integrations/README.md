High priority Trusted Advisor checks require further investigation as they help you secure and optimize your account to align with AWS best practices. Notifications are classified by risk category (Security, Fault Tolerance, Performance, Cost and Service Limits) and sent to your preferred monitoring or DevOps tools at a preconfigured interval.
