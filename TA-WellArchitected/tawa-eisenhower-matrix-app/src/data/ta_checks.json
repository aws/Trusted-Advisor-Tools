Replication lag occurs when the asynchronous updates made to the read replica cannot keep up with the updates happening on the primary database instance.

For example, it can be caused by recently replaced/launched replica instances from older backups and these replicas requiring substantial time to catch-up to the primary database instance and live transactions. This ReplicaLag may dwindle over time as catch-up occurs. Another example could be that the transaction velocity able to be achieved on the primary database instance is higher than the replication process or replica infrastructure is able to match. This ReplicaLag may grow over time as replication fails to keep pace with the primary database performance.  Finally, the workload may be bursty throughout different periods of the day/month/etc. that result in occasional ReplicaLag to fall behind.  Your team should investigate which possible root cause has contributed to high ReplicaLag for the database, and possibly change the database instance type or other characteristics of the workload to ensure data continuity on the replica matches your requirements.<br>\n<br>\n<b></b><b>Additional Resources</b><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with MySQL replication in Amazon RDS</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with MySQL read replicas</a>",

Although some scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often lower your costs by managing the number and size of your instances.\n<br><br>\nEstimated monthly savings are calculated by using the current usage rate for On-Demand Instances and the estimated number of days the instance might be underutilized. Actual savings will vary if you are using Reserved Instances or Spot Instances, or if the instance is not running for a full day.

To allow Amazon Route 53 to route queries to the region with the lowest network latency, you should create latency resource record sets for a particular domain name (such as example.com) in different regions. If you create only one latency resource record set for a domain name, all queries are routed to one region, and you pay extra for latency-based routing without getting the benefits. Hosted zones created by AWS services won’t appear in your check results.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Alert Criteria</h4>\n<br>\nYellow: Only one latency resource record set is configured for a particular domain name.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Recommended Action</h4>\n<br>\nIf you have resources in multiple regions, be sure to define a latency resource record set for each region; see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency\" target=\"_blank\">Latency-Based Routing</a>.<br>\nIf you have resources in only one region, consider creating resources in more than one region and define latency resource record sets for each; see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency\" target=\"_blank\">Latency-Based Routing</a>.<br>\nIf you don't want to use multiple regions, you should use a simple resource record set; see  <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with Resource Record Sets</a>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Additional Resources</h4>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Route 53 Pricing</a>",

To help increase the level of fault tolerance in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) when using Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend running an equal number of instances across multiple Availability Zones in a region.
